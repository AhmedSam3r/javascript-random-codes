    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <!--best practice to add script element at the end of html content-->
    <!--Why?
        1)Browser run code top-bottom. 
            so if we put js in header, it will render it first and it won't be able to render the content of the page
            ==>leading to bad UX
        2)Almost always the code we have between  script elements want to talk with the elements on that page like showing/hiding some elements.
            ==> we are confident that all elements are rendered by the browser-->
    <script>
        // printing a string
        console.log('Hello world');
    </script>
</body>
